            <h2 id="deliverables">DELIVERABLES</h2>
            <p>As a deliverable, we ask that any generated data and findings be shared in the public domain, adhere to the <strong>FAIR Principles</strong>, and are reported as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>a preprint of research work submitted for publication, or</li>
                <li>a technical report.</li>
              </ul>
                <p>The <strong>'FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship'</strong> provide guidelines to improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse of digital assets, so that future researchers can leverage your research findings. We further encourage researchers to identify peer-reviewed journals, conferences, and workshops that are relevant to the work they are undertaking, and plan to submit to these venues.</p>
