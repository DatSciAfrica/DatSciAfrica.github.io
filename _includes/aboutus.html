            <p>Data Science Africa (DSA) is a grassroots organization that was founded in 2015 to provide quality training in data science, machine learning, and other emerging technologies with the aim of leveraging these technologies for the development of solutions to African problems.</p>

            <p>DSA bridges the gap whereby students at African universities have limited exposure to cutting-edge machine learning and data science. In addition, there were very few events in Africa at which research aimed at developing solutions to African problems using data science was presented.</p>
            <p>The first DSA summer school and workshop event held in Nyeri at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in 2015, established the format that would be adopted for subsequent DSA events - a summer school during which participants are trained on the theory and practice of machine learning, followed by workshops during which researchers present work that leverages data science to solve problems of interest in the African context.</p>
            
            <p>At the time of writing, 11 of these capacity-strengthening DSA events have been held in 8 African countries. Between 2015 and 2017, all DSA events were held in East Africa, therefore, in a bid to broaden DSAâ€™s reach to the entire African continent, DSA held the first West African event in Abuja, Nigeria in 2018, followed by an event in Ghana in 2019. Further, during the COVID-19 pandemic, DSA held an online event organized and hosted by Sol-Plaatje University in South Africa. Then in 2023,DSA held an event in Kigali, Rwanda , and most recently, in 2024 the event was in Nyeri Kenya.</p>
