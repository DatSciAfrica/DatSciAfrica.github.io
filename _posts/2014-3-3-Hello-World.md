title: Welcome to Data Science Africa
---

Data from a vast array of sources is becoming available in many African countries. Machine learning and analysis are being applied to solve real problems on the ground.

  In Africa, a number of problems in areas such as healthcare,
  agriculture, disaster response and wildlife conservation would
  benefit greatly if domain experts were exposed to data science
  techniques. These skills would allow practitioners to extract
  useful information from these abundant sources of raw data.
-- Dr. Ciira Maina

We at Data Science Africa aim to create a hub in the network of data science researchers across Africa, by,

- Providing an index of researchers and practitioners in the field of Data Science in Africa
- A resource of lectures and notes
- Links and sources of information and potential data sources
- In the future a discussion forum to discuss Data Science questions
- An online presence for data science conferences and workshops
