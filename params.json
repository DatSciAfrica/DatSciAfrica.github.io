{"name":"Data Science Africa","tagline":"Making Data Science relevant for Africa","body":"Welcome to Data Science in Africa. Data from a vast array of sources is becoming available in many African countries. Machine learning and analysis are being applied to solve real problems on the ground.\r\n\r\n>In Africa, a number of problems in areas such as healthcare,\r\n>agriculture, disaster response and wildlife conservation would\r\n>benefit greatly if domain experts were exposed to data science\r\n>techniques. These skills would allow practitioners to extract\r\n>useful information from these abundant sources of raw data.\r\nDr. Ciira Maina\r\n\r\nWe at Data Science Africa aim to create a hub in the network of data science researchers across Africa, by,\r\n\r\n- Providing an index of researchers and practitioners in the field of Data Science in Africa\r\n- A resource of lectures and notes\r\n- Links and sources of information and potential data sources\r\n- In the future a discussion forum to discuss Data Science questions\r\n- An online presence for data science conferences and workshops","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
