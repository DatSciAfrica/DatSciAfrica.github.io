 abstract: 'Across Malawi, there is a challenge of linking aquatic data to river flow regimes. Aquatic biodiversity data is generally scarce. When present, there are huge gaps in referenced scientific publications. For most rivers e.g., Ruo river in Mulanje district, there is little or no published literature on its flow regimes linked to the presence and absence of aquatic biodiversity despite being a Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) in Malawi. With an increasing research demand in the field of biodiversity in Malawi, it is important to understand the complex ecological issues surrounding river flow regimes and biodiversity for best management and protection of aquatic resources in the face of the changing climate, rising human population and industrial developments. A wide global coverage with continuous studies in different seasons and multiple time points would allow policy makers to compare diversity change between regions, and identify drivers of diversity loss over time. The promise of these advancements will only be met, however, via improvements in data accessibility, data discoverability, and development of data standards.'

 researcher: 'Junior'
 abstract: 'Current efforts in biomedical AI/ML are hampered by data that is difficult to access and siloed [1, 2, 3]. Even public data is hard to process because relationships between data elements have to be guessed from limited information, such as column headers and row names. For complex data to be truly useful, we need to enable machines to not only access the data, but also interpret and incorporate this data into their algorithms. This will enable automatic inferencing beyond one-to-one equivalence matches to more complicated relationships across datasets.The long term vision of this data science project is to unlock Kenyan biological data, so that it can be made available for machine analysis in services such as GeneCup. I will start with the public GeneNetwork (GN) resource that contains over 20 years of heterogeneous experimental data that has resulted in thousands of publications [5]. GN is a long-running biomedical web service that has been in existence since 1994 [6, 7, 8, 9]. GN enables researchers with little programming experience to access large data 2 through a web interface and to run complex statistical models. Data is also presented through API endpoints—accessible in programming environments like R, Python and live Jupyter notebooks. GN is uniquely centered on hosting genetics data, phenotyping, Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) and Genome Wide Association (GWA) studies in human and model species 3, such as mouse and rat. Having all this data from different experiments spanning over 20 years in one database with a simple web UI allows any researcher to uniquely run analyses across many studies.'

 abstract: 'Diseases that affect the respiratory systems of humans are one of the main causes of death across the globe according to the World Health Organization (WHO). More than 90% of respiratory deaths occur in low- and middle income countries.. Many of the germs that cause respiratory diseases are spread by droplets that come from breathing, coughing and sneezing making them highly contagious. From the COVID-19 experience, there is a need for a personalized, easy to use and convenient mechanism to self- detect a potential contagious disease at home before going to the public, thus to limit the spread of infections. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) provides a great opportunity to bring detection and monitoring of respiratory diseases at home at low cost. However, current IoT/AI integrated solutions are based on cloud based architectures, with IoT sensors uploading data to cloud AI models. Beside the privacy issue, this kind of architecture is particularly a challenge in rural Africa due to connectivity and cost constraints. Considering this particular case of detecting respiratory diseases, we recently validated during our Master thesis project the concept of using an emerging AI technique for inferencing on resource constrained devices known as tinyML. Using an open source dataset of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) exhaled by humans when breathing, we trained a tinyML model to infer Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) . This proposed project takes a next step in maturing our findings which consists of implementing the physical hardware embedding the previously trained TinyML model and therefore validate the onboard inference in real settings. A given person will breathe into a tube that canalizes the exhaled air towards VOC sensors while his/her body temperature is being captured contactless by an infrared temperature sensor. The collected data will be processed on the device and a tinyML algorithm used to detect if the sample is infected or not. A feedback will be shown on the device and also sent to a mobile phone via GSM. The proposed solution will be a great value in the process of mass collection of exhaled breath data in Africa where specific datasets are still missing, thus complementing the few breaths that are collected in healthcare facilities. This will enable the training of efficient AI models for respiratory diseases and contribute towards the achievement of sustainable development goals on good health and wellbeing by the year 2030.'

 abstract: 'Za-Kpota is a municipality located in southern Benin, at the junction between sedimentary and basement formations. Za-Kpota relies on groundwater for drinking water supply to the populations. But, this resource is is constantly under strain, due to the progression of both point and diffuse sources of pollution. It is therefore important that attention be given to the quality of this resource to limit or reduce the sources of pollution. It is with this in mind that this project has been written. It aims to understand the spatio-temporal evolution of the physico-chemical quality of groundwater in the region of interest. It will be carried out through the diachronic analysis of land use between 2008 and 2022 thanks to the processing of Landsat/sentinel satellite data, demographic data, physico-chemical data from hand dug wells and boreholes, soil and piezometric data. Based on this set of data, a groundwater physicochemical quality prediction model will be generated. Groundwater pollution can come from a variety of different point and non-point sources of contamination mainly from agricultural, domestic (inadequate sanitation), fuel storage, medical, and other common sources. Furthermore, the prediction model will be used as guiding tool for the local authorities in charge of groundwater resources management. In overall, the proposed project will contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6 focusing on water and sanitation, towards improving the well-being of the dwellings inhabitants.'

 researcher: 'Junior'
 abstract: 'Online hate is a growing problem in Nigeria, across Africa and the world. It inflicts harm on users who are exposed to it, pollutes and disrupts online communities, and can be a precursor to serious offline harm and violence. Machine Learning Tools for automatically finding and rating the hatefulness of online content can help to address this problem, supporting content moderation efforts, social media monitoring and threat evaluation. However, at present, there is almost no hate detection tools available for any Nigerian language – either in academia or industry. This means that Nigerian users of online services are more likely to not be protected against hate which can severely restrict free expression and open access. We propose addressing this problem by introducing NaijaHate the first labelled dataset for hate in 3 major languages in Nigeria, as well as baseline machine learning models for each language. We envisage the final dataset will comprise 20k entries for each language. Through this work, we will investigate the various cultural, linguistic and technical challenges of working across so many diverse and low-resource languages on an inherently subjective concept like hate. This is a first-of-its kind project which has the potential to transform how online hate is understood, researched and tackled in Nigeria. If successful, we will: (1) advance academic knowledge into hate detection and Natural Language Processing in Nigeria and Africa at large; (2) have a positive social impact by enabling and supporting the monitoring and evaluation work of civil society to tackle online hate; and (3) enable new technological tools to be used by large tech platforms by providing ready-to-use baseline machine learning models.'

Natural Language Processing (NLP) has shed light on African languages and provided an opportunity for them to be integrated into ICT. Many African languages including are hampered in their use in ICT due to a lack of speech version documentation. This project aims to develop a speech dataset in Yorùbá and Pidgin languages for healthcare delivery, machine learning and other NLP tasks. This project will focus on the implementation of both the Yorùbá and Pidgin speech datasets for use in an antenatal section of healthcare delivery.

 abstract: 'Tree diseases leads to losses of over 2 billion US dollars globally and some diseases also affect cash crops leading to even greater losses. In this research I propose to collect data over a period of 1 year in the most densely forested areas of Kenya for forecasting purposes on tree diseases caused by the fungal family known as Botryosphaeriaceae. From previous research specie of the family have been recorded in over 200 tree species worldwide and the data will be based on field data, laboratory experiments and analyses. Diseases forecasting has been practiced for over a century now focusing mainly on short rotation agricultural crops. The method uses a combination of data on the pathogen (fungi), the host species characteristics, weather patterns and machine learning to come up with algorithms for prediction of disease patterns and future infections. I work at the Forest mycology lab in Kenya Forestry Research Institute where we have data on pathogens from 1952 to date. A combination of field observations of fungi on Cypress which are recording a decline, historical data in the laboratory’s repository and machine learning methods we will be able to forecast disease outbreaks and inform decision making and policy for the country and region at large. There are currently 10000 hectares of Cypress (Cupressus lusitanica) plantations in the Rift Valley gazette public forests. There is more than 3000 extra hectares on farms in woodlots planted by farmers for various products. These stands are valued at 10 billion Kenya shillings that would be of great economic impact if lost to tree diseases.'

 abstract: 'Beans are one of the most significant, widely cultivated and consumed crops across the African continent which not only enhance the nutrition and health of individuals as well as food security but also greatly contribute to the national economies of many African nations. According to the Uganda Beans Sector Analysis Report by the Commercial Agriculture for Smallholders and Agribusiness, Uganda is the second biggest producer of beans in Africa after Tanzania producing over 1 million tons on 670,737 hectares. Beans farmers experience a number of challenges throughout the plant lifecycle with pests and diseases identified as one of the major challenges. This greatly leads to decreased farm yields and eventually losses in terms of financial investment and time. In 2017, a study revealed that Angular Leaf Spot disease alone was responsible for a massive output loss of 384.2 tons per year across Sub-Saharan Africa [1]. Furthermore, majority of the bean production is done by small holder farmers who don’t possess adequate mechanisms as well as information to combat these diseases in a timely manner. In this research, the aim is to develop a cost-effective machine learning-based diagnosis tool for bean diseases. An existing open-source beans dataset created by a team of scientists from the National Crops Resources Research Institute and Makerere University that contains 5031 Angular Leaf Spot (ALS) images, 5020 Bean Rust images, and 5284 healthy images will be utilized to train a model based on machine learning that detects Bean Rust and Angular Leaf Spot in bean leaves. The machine learning problem will be framed as a supervised learning image classification task taking advantage of the latest state of the art classification models accounting for deployment conditions including low computation power and short inference time.'

 abstract: 'With the growing need for speedy, affordable and individualized Assistive Devices (ADs), classification and clustering Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been used for human gait data analysis for appropriate device prediction. Also, despite the ML models being developed continuously, their uptake in the health sector has still remained low because they operate in black box restricting the clinicians from understanding how they operate. The study will explore use of Explainable Machine Learning in human gait analysis. Regardless of the massive data and technological advancement, most of these devices are hand crafted by orthopedists. Through the use of ML models and sensor technology would enhance accuracy. This study proposes to address the speed, affordability and trustworthiness challenges by developing a ML models to be utilized in the analysis of sensor-based gait and human anatomy data from the patient data and reconstructing the 3D design model suitable for fabrication using the 3D printer to generate the product. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) has been recommended as the most appropriate Explainable Model. Unfortunately it is not always stable. The study proposes to optimize LIME to attain stability by combining Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) techniques. HugaDB and GaitRec human gait datasets will be used for training the model for device prediction. Movi and MPII Human shape body models will be used to train the model for 3D reconstruction'

 abstract: 'In Kenya, aquaculture has gradually grown over the years and presents a great potential in bridging the widening gap between fish demand and supply. Capture fish from lakes and rivers has been the main source of commercial fish. However, maximum sustainable yields from them has exceeded and the output from this sources has plateaued over the past 5 years (Obiero et al., 2021). On the other hand, aquaculture production has remained relatively stable over the same period and accounted for 12.8 % of the country’s fish output in 2019 (KNBS, 2020). The fishing pressure exerted on an inland fishery is a function of: human population density and socio-economic dependence on inland fish. There are many developing nations with high aspirations for strong aquaculture development to feed their fast-growing populations. This requires appropriate policies, strategies, private and public investment, and cooperation with a clear focus on sustainable production increases. Aquaculture provides a sustainable alternative that could spur growth and economically empower women and young people (FAO, 2017). For women to be empowered and benefit from its potential advantages; attention must be given to the species grown, preconceptions about gender roles and control over production. FAO’s efforts to present an accurate and more detailed picture of world aquaculture development status and trends is affected by lack of information (FAO-SOFIA, 2020). In Kenya, lack of reporting coupled with insufficient quality and completeness in reported data, hinders policy and planning. There is need for comprehensive analysis of the suitability of the environment, human, and economic resources available for development in the aquaculture sector. Remote sensing is a promising assessment tool that could estimate fisheries productivity and yield (FAO-SOFIA, 2016). However, its application to inland fisheries and aquaculture is lagging far behind than in other sectors (FAO-SOFIA, 2016). Geographical information system (GIS) by satellite remote sensing holds a large potential to complement the need for routine and reliable data on aquaculture at large scale. The proposed work aims at using GIS in fisheries management.This will promote and protect the productivity of fishery, ensure socioeconomic benefit, environmental sustainability and maximize economic yield. GIS will be used as a tool for mapping out the potential fish farming regions in Kenya (Focal Counties include: Nyeri, Kirinyaga, and Kisumu). These Counties were selected on the basis of being key fish farming areas. Sentinel-2 images implemented on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform will be utilized to develop and evaluate an automatic fishpond mapping workflow. The workflow will include the spectral filtering phase that uses a pixel selection technique and an image segmentation method to automatically identify all-year-inundated water bodies and spatial filtering phase to further classify all-year-inundated water bodies into fishponds and non-fishponds using object-based features (OBF). Potential fish farms in Kenya will be identified and mapped out. The identified fish farms will thereafter be validated through field identification. Enumerators will recruited in the focal Counties and used to administer questionnaires through open data kit (ODK). Data collection parameters will include: County, GPS coordinates, household details and details related to fish farming. Data generated from this study will give a baseline information on the current distribution of fish farms in the selected Counties and also serves as a strategic and operational decision support tool for implementation of fishery management regulation. We will develop and online platform with an interactive dashboard where the information will be accessible to different stakeholders.The suitability map generated will highlight the distributions of fish farms in different regions and enable identification of areas that support aquaculture and where more fish farms can be established. This will enable integration of management objectives'

 researcher: 'Junior'
 abstract: 'Extreme Value Theory is useful for determining the probability of rare occurrences such as floods and earthquakes, as well as their return periods. The use of EVT, which considers truncation at high levels, will improve the accuracy of modeling, resulting in more effective management practices. Many studies of the dam&apos;s functioning were inspired by the nationwide power disruptions in 2006 termed "Dumsor", which means "On/Off." These studies focused on instances where critical dam components, such as the spillways, were fully operating. Recent literature has shed light on the possibility of truncation at high levels. Recent failures of the Oroville dam (tallest dam in the United States), Sanford, and Edenville dams necessitate a thorough evaluation of the Akosombo dam&apos;s performance in extremely rare situations, such as excessive floods combined with other extremely rare events, such as spillway damage, as seen in the Oroville dam failure. We propose a study to investigate the extremes of the Akosombo dam. We&apos;ll compare results from both truncated and underlying non-truncated distribution parameters. Pairs of minimum and maximum daily water levels from the Akosombo dam between the periods January, 1966 and December, 2013 would be collected. To determine the dam&apos;s socio-economic impact, dam engineers as well as natives of the surrounding environment would be interviewed.'

 researcher: 'Junior'
 abstract: 'Agriculture is a major driver of the economies in African countries. Due to poor climate and the adoption of greenhouse farming, farmers depend on irrigation from time to time to water plants with an aim of increasing productivity. Existing irrigation systems are manually operated leading to, among other problems, water wastages, untimely irrigation leading to losses and high cost of operation. The emerging technologies of Internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly being used in precision farming systems and many other use cases. Such technologies have been exploited in attempts to solve the irrigation problem through the adoption of smart irrigation systems. However, existing smart irrigation systems are either based on thresholds or cloud based data analytics. The use of thresholds is not appropriate for such a solution that involve many parameters that change over time. In addition, the implementation of cloud-based analytics is a challenge in Africa as a result of connectivity and cost challenges. This project is aimed at the design and development of an Edge AI-based smart irrigation system. The system will have a sensing unit in which soil moisture, soil temperature and soil humidity data will be collected in real time by sensors in a farm. The collected data will be integrated with forecasted weather information and then be processed on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense microcontroller. An edge AI-based model will be used on the device to predict when to irrigate or not without the need for connectivity. The irrigation valve is automatically opened or closed based on the applied algorithms from time to time. The implementation of this project will ensure a data-driven irrigation leading to increased yields and water management. This will go a long way towards the attainment of sustainable development goals of food security and water.'

 researcher: 'Junior'
 abstract: 'Ethiopia has three climatological rainy seasons, namely February–May (FMAM, known as Belg in Ethiopia), June–September (JJAS, known as Kiremt), and October–January (ONDJ, known as Bega). The Ethiopian National Meteorological Agency started seasonal forecasting since 1987 and the seasonal forecast methodology is based on selection of analogous years mainly using the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index. The analogue forecasting method is a way of predicting the climate for the forthcoming season based on similar patterns of sea surface temperature, upper-air geopotential height and sea level pressure in the past, and therefore has an influence on the skill of the of the forecast due to the limited extent of available historical data and impacts of climate change. Further, the forecast product from the consensus-based approach (analogue method) is not available in digital format hence difficult to verify it. Recently, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommended the National Meteorological Services and Regional Climate Centres to move from the consensus-based (subjective) forecasting system to an objective forecasting system that can be traced, reproduced and verified. In the recommendations, assessment of the skill of forecasting models for different regions was stressed. Furthermore, selection of a subset of models which have better skill for the region of interest for the construction of the relevant multimodal ensemble is recommended. PyCPT is a Python-based statistical tool developed by the International Research Institute (IRI) for constructing a seasonal climate forecast model (Canonical correlation analysis-CCA, Principal Component Regression-PCR, Multiple linear regression-MLR), performing model validation (retroactive and cross-validation method), and producing forecasts given updated data (probabilistic and deterministic). It is designed for producing seasonal climate forecasts using model output statistic (MOS) corrections to climate predictions from general circulation model (GCM). The tool is also designed for producing forecasts for mass-production of seasonal and sub-seasonal forecast and probabilistic flexible forecasts. PyCPT provide seamless access to the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) the Copernicus Climate Change Services (C3S), the Sub seasonal-to-Seasonal Prediction Project (S2S) and the Sub seasonal Experiment (SubX) Databases, respectively, via the IRI Data Library. This study therefore aims to evaluate the skill of the global prediction models over Ethiopia for the different rainfall seasons using different predictor domains and forecast leadtime. The findings of this study contribute to the improvement of the forecast and forecasting system of the National Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia, which currently produces the seasonal climate forecast using consensus-based approach.'

 abstract: 'We propose to develop a 3-D printed smartphone add-on spectrometer that determines the state of disease of a cassava plant before it is visibly symptomatic. There have been some initiatives to build a small relatively cheap spectrometer to do these types of analyses. However, most of the current options are in the 100s of dollars which, while being cheaper than the higher end spectrometers, are still in the prohibitive range for smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa. The non wet chemistry technology to identify disease in non-symptomatic plants is also still largely missing. In this regard we expect our work to contribute to two main outcomes. (i) That it will provide the evidence of building a really low-cost technology that can be easily scaled even without a large production line. This is a technology that can be printed. (ii) That this artifact that we will develop will actually be able to identify disease early such that a smallholder farmer can cause an intervention to her garden. We expect that success in this endeavor will result in a large trial to validate its applicability for use in alleviating the food insecurity problem in Sub-Saharan Africa.Food security continues to be a big issue on the international agenda. Presently it takes second position in the sustainable development goals 2030. Crop diseases are still a major cause of food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Cassava is a key food security crop for Africa and leveraging the advances in computational methods to address some of the related pertinent issues is key. We propose to tackle the most challenging problem in cassava diagnostics - determination of disease in the field using low-cost smartphone assisted technologies. Particularly we focus on early diagnosis of disease in cassava plants before they are symptomatic. Cassava takes 9 - 12 months to grow and presently diagnosis is only done once the plant is symptomatic at which point it may be too late for the farmer to uproot or spray the plants. A key aspect of our solution is that the technology should be cheap and usable by a smallholder farmer; the person most affected by the problem of food insecurity. To tackle the problem we will develop a 3-D printed smartphone add-on spectrometer that determines the state of disease from spectra collected from the leaves of a cassava plant. This study builds from an existing prototype [9] aiming to deploy the low-cost 3-D printed smartphone add-on spectrometer for field diagnosis.'

 researcher: 'Early Career (Project Extension)'
 abstract: 'Rice is a staple food for nearly half of the world’s population and one of the strategic crops in Egypt that feeds many of the Egyptian people. Rice consumes almost 80% of the total irrigation freshwater resources. However, with the looming water shortages in the country due to urbanization, industrialization and explosive population growth, fresh water is becoming rare which is a significant challenge to agricultural production in general and to rice plant cultivation in specific. In this case, water/drought stress is visually manifested on rice plant appearance [1] and results in lowered production by reducing cell growth, cell elongation and cell expansion [2][3]. In this project, we propose to develop a system for rice plant water stress detection and diagnosis by fusing multispectral imaging data acquired from 1) ground level and 2) from multiple satellites. The former will be attained by using a multispectral camera to provide high-resolution and leaf level information whereas the later will tap into the huge volumes of imagery provided by free satellite constellations including NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) satellites especially ESA’s Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 to provide medium resolution and field level information. A data fusion model based on deep neural networks (DNNs) [4][5] will be used to combine the multi-sourced data and make accurate prediction and geolocalization of rice water stresses. A GPS-powered mobile-friendly application, RicePRO, will also be developed to provide interactive in-field guidance to location of affected regions. In order to be able to train our deep fusion model, we plan to collect a unique rice water stress dataset where ground level multispectral images are geo-registered with satellite-acquired multispectral images. The dataset along with deep fusion model architecture and analysis algorithms will be made publicly available to researchers and government agencies via an open-access portal to be hosted on Nile University servers. We also plan to publish the dataset and our analysis results which will ensure wide reach in the research community. It is worth noting that the current project builds on the technologies and hardware developed in the earlier project on rice disease diagnosis using multispectral ground-level imagery. The proposed project will implement a functional system to 1) collect multispectral images of rice water stresses using ground level camera and from satellite imagery sources, 2) annotate and geo-register the collected images to create a multi-sourced image dataset, 3) use the dataset to create a deep fusion model that is able to detect crop stress from the ground and/or in satellite images, and 4) leverage the model to create a mobile-friendly in-field rice water stress detection and localization application, named RicePRO, to discover rice water stresses and guide stakeholders to location of affected field regions. The collected data and developed model will be used to advance research and development of early detection systems that help alleviate and effectively address rice crop problems.'

 abstract: 'Crop yield prediction is a vital tool in many projects of food security, global trade and overall farm management. Methods based on remote sensing and data science are the contemporary ones delivering several advantages over the traditional methods. The purpose of the current research is to further increase the yield prediction capability of the AutoML with GLM model via employing several potential predictors and other existing methods. This study is initiated based on results of the previous promising method (AutoML with GLM model) that unleash the capability of remote sensing and machine learning for wheat yield prediction under smallholder system in Ethiopia. Accordingly, four specific objectives are set. First, enhance the prediction capability of the AutoML with GLM method through incorporation of bio-physical predictors. Second, integrate the AutoML with GLM method with crop model and further increase prediction capability. Third, combine the AutoML and GL method with time integration yield prediction approach. Fourth, prepare wheat yield prediction map of the study area. The current study is meant to comprehensively incorporate the major promising yield prediction methods available in literature with the previous method developed in an earlier research. Accordingly, predictors will be derived from the recent soil map of Ethiopia and satellite based rainfall and temperature products will be used to set predictors that potentially integrate the importance of moisture stress and temperature on yield prediction. The study will evaluate and select the most promising crop models and design an innovative approach to create synergy with the previous (AutoML with GLM) approach. Remote sensing based time integration regression method, which offers higher capability in some previous studies, will be also applied to integrate with the AutoML and GLM method. The study will use high resolution satellite products from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. CHIRPS rainfall product shall be used to derive moisture related predictors. The outputs of the study will be validated using primary data collected (yield) from two districts for the year 2023. Several packages supporting the machine learning process will be applied and the H2O platform which is open source, scalable and in-memory will be the major one. The successful implementation of the study will deliver reliable wheat yield prediction method demonstrating proven skill using validation datasets. The method will be used to predict yield at scale and wheat yield maps shall be prepared. The research findings will be published in a journal having international reputation in data science. Furthermore, results shall be presented in conferences of data science and remote sensing such as the ones organized by Data Science Africa (DSA).'

 abstract: 'Nigeria, like other third world nations, is suffering from insufficient electricity supply that dwindle technology advancement such that there is the lack of technical know-how to compare with advanced nations of the world technology. Environmental degradation that results from the series of processes that are involved in the exploration of crude oil has been a call of serious concern in Nigeria as reported by many researchers (Karl, 2005; Flinn, 2016). The health of the local population is being impaired by risk incidences relation to toil and exploration activities. Since the local communities within oil producing states often face formidable environmental challenges that generate conflicts and health risks (Adekola et al., 2017) then there is need to explore other sources of environmentally friendly energy. Adedapo et al. (2013) opined that the Niger Delta where oil and gas exploitation is extensively practice, may exhaust by 2040 and so suggested that there is need for more exploration technologies to save Nigeria energy need before 2040. Additionally, Oyedepo (2012) affirmed that presently in Nigeria, 60% to 70% of its population does not have access to electricity, and even those with access 40% to 30% cannot have up to 3 hours of electricity in a day. To have sufficient electricity supply means prospecting for more energy resources, and harnessing same to meet the energy noted. Hence the need for geothermal exploration to provide alternative energy resource that is sustainable for Nigeria before 2040. There is the need for this work to give a full analysis of the geothermal potential in the area. Also, the Tertiary/Quaternary volcanic rocks and U mineralization in the north-eastern Nigeria is a good geological evidence of potential geothermal energy.'

 abstract: 'Typical applications of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) include touch panel contacts, electrodes for LCD and electro chromic displays, energy conserving architectural windows, defogging aircraft and automobile windows, heat-reflecting coatings to increase light bulb efficiency, gas sensors, antistatic window coatings, wear resistant layers on glass, etc. TCO films are also widely used, amongst other oxides as both antireflection coatings (ARC) and as transparent conductive electrodes for various solar cells technologies due to their promising performance in terms of electrical conductivity and transparency in visible light. Thin films of transparent conducting materials are relevant for next generation solar cells where the anti-reflection coating acts both to increase the solar radiance towards the cell, but also as an active electrode. The ultimate goal is to replace the semiconducting conduction bands used today with a transparent material. The challenge is the creation of nanostructured quantum dots which are expected to increase the efficiency of the material in energy conversion. It is therefore important to identify the physical and chemical state of all species present in the TCO films in order to confirm the presence or absence of nanoparticles with different physical and chemical states. In order to ensure good properties, it is necessary to have well defined crystalline material that conducts well. The collaborating institutions produced such materials using physical and cheap chemical synthesis processes. The expanding use of TCO materials, especially for the production of transparent electrodes for optoelectronic device applications, has developed into a global multi-billion $US economy that in general depends on the availability of ITO. This economy is endangered by the scarcity and high price of In. The situation drives the search for alternative TCO materials to replace ITO, and motivates an intensive investigation of the physics and chemistry of TCO materials. The main significant progress in the research and development of TCO thin films has been made in understanding the physics of TCO semiconductors. The physical and chemical processes that make possible the coexistence of electrical conductivity and optical transparency are well clarified and understood. In particular, the role of oxygen vacancies and various dopants in the formation of shallow donor levels is well established. In addition to binary TCOs, progress has also been made in developing new TCO compounds, consisting of combined segregated-binaries, ternary and quaternary oxides.'

 abstract: 'As evidenced worldwide, the breakout of Covid-19 disrupted a large portion of social and economic welfare of the world population, systems and businesses. For instance, organizations were forced to rapidly modify policies to cater for a hybrid of remote and in-office workforces. Dedicated and sophisticated adversaries, such as the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) are taking advantage of security challenges of distributed workforces which has resulted into an escalation of cybercrime. The security challenges are propagated by things like; remote workers switching between a range of mobile devices, using public Wi-Fi network and remote collaboration tools. For instance, reports highlight an increase in mobile threats such as mobile malware that can be exploited to cause Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, SMS spam and data theft. According to the McAfee’s report of 2020, global losses from cybercrime now total over $1 trillion, a more than 50% increase from 2018 [1]. Cybersecurity Ventures expects global cybercrime costs to grow by 15% per year over the next five years, reaching $10.5 trillion annually by 2025 [2]. Traditional defense approaches are no longer adequate to stop dedicated and sophisticated adversaries, such as the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) [3, 4]. APT continually gathers data from a target to gain access and fulfil certain goal conditions. Defenders must persistently analyse adversary lateral movements in distributed workforce network scenarios to predict adversary end goal and the cost of reaching the goal, then apply proactive mitigation strategies without disrupting the organization’s core services. Therefore, this research proposes a defense approach to address APT that stem from distributed workforce vulnerabilities. Furthermore, this study proposes to leverage Machine Learning and AI to intelligently detect and predict dynamic behavior of attackers as they traverse environments, e.g. from home networks to office networks to achieve their end goals.'

 abstract: 'Maize and sorghum yield prediction that is accurate and timely is critical for the agricultural supply chain and food security in the country. For decades, previous research in Tanzania has relied on either climate or satellite data to develop empirical or statistical models. Laudien et al., (2020) provides a forecasting approach of maize yields in Tanzania based on climatic predictors at the sub-national scale about 6 weeks before the harvest. However, this study is based on a statistical yield forecast covering the time period from 2009 to 2019 only and cannot be extrapolated to other spatial and temporal contexts. Volk et. al (2021) provides a simulation study from the Singida region that investigates the adaptation measures to prevent future maize yield decline in Tanzania for the baseline period 1980 - 2012. However, this study does not use climate and satellite data to predict maize yields. Again, this method involves only one crop while machine learning (ML) - based modular models that are suited for many crops are required in Tanzania. The main objective of this project is to address the need for reliable and reusable ML-driven crop yields prediction models using climate and remote sensing big data to make better crop yield predictions in Tanzania. We will use multi-source data, such as monthly climate data, satellite data (i.e., vegetation indices (VIs)), fertilizer data, and soil data, to predict maize and sorghum yield at the plot scale of small-scale farmers from 1994 to 2021 in order to investigate the accuracy of different inputs to yield prediction. A cloud -based Internet of Agro-Things (IoATs) system for monitoring crop growth in small-holder farmers for Maize (Zea Mays) and sorghum fields in Mwanza and Morogoro regions will be developed. The project will develop farm-scale crop yield prediction models that would allow more than 50,000 small-holder farmers to get early season or end of season recommendations/predictions of their crop yields. The project also develops a smart farming system for small-holder farmers based on low-cost IoT sensors and popular data storage services and data analytics services on the cloud for farm-scale crop monitoring and prediction in real-time. Moreover, the project develops new strategies that help to understand the importance of different data sources (weather and climate patterns, remote sensing, crop type, soil type etc) in predicting crop yield for different crops across different regions in Tanzania.'

 researcher: 'Early Career'
 abstract: 'Low production in maize yields is mainly caused by water stress due to unpredictable seasonal rains influenced by climate change (Mourice et al., 2014). Mourice et al. (2014) did research to determine the effectiveness of the current crop management techniques in rain-fed and found that there is a reduced maize yield of about 79% in Tanzania. So it is paramount to monitor maize yield and predict its performance for mitigation purposes. Prediction of the crop yield as part of the food security mitigation method will allow the government to mitigate the crop performance early enough and advise the farmers accordingly. Prediction of crop yields is the investigation to determine future agronomic variables such as density, vigour, maturity, and disease, which can be used as yield indicators. But typically, it means the yield can be determined by measuring the output of the crop from the farm. Tanzania continually calculates each crop yield and places the results by districts and regions. Though crop management practices can highly influence yield, natural weather conditions still play a big part in crop performance in Tanzania (Mourice et al., 2015).To achieve prediction requirements, most of the researchers in Tanzania have proposed the use of the water requirements specification index (WRSI). Still, they have concluded that the prediction correlation was very low and suggested a new method to be researched (Tarnavsky et al., 2018 and Boult et al., 2020). This is due to the limitation of the formula to find the alternative relationship between the weather information features incorporated to it and the yield information (Tarnavsky et al., 2018 and Boult et al., 2020). The WRSI does not provide a numerical prediction of yield and instead, it only provides categorical predictions like Excellent, very good, good, satisfactory and poor performance (Tarnavsky et al., 2018 and Boult et al., 2020). Alternatively, in other parts of the world, they have tried to use machine learning models to rectify the problem in some crops and predict numerical yield information (Liakos et al., 2018). Generally, parameters in agriculture that can be used to train algorithms to predict crop performance include crop information (growth stages, leaf area index), soil information (soil type, soil pH, soil cation exchange capacity), humidity (rainfall, precipitation), nutrients (occurring natural nutrients, added nutrients), field management(irrigation, fertilization, chemical application), solar information (gamma radiation, temperature, photoperiod, shortwave radiation), vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Enhanced vegetation index (EVI)), wind speed, pressure, historical yield information, and images. Hence, the machine learning algorithms would greatly improve the prediction of maize crop performance and provide a more accurate yield prediction than WRSI, which uses limited information and mostly water-based information.'

 abstract: 'The public health sector in Zambia has a deficit of qualified radiologists, with a report of five (5) radiologists servicing a population of 17 million individuals, as of 2019 [3]. This shortfall poses a number of challenges with interpretation of medical images. Coupled with this problem is the fact that the recent years have seen a rise in the type of medical image modalities used in the health sector, including an exponential growth of medical imaging data requiring interpretation. These challenges can potentially be addressed through the implementation of efficient and effective medical imaging workflows using Enterprise Medical Imaging (EMI) techniques [6, 7]. In addition, our prior work has highlighted how EMI strategies can help address some of the challenges associated with radiological workflows in Zambia [10]. A followup study has further identified potential opportunities that exist in order to leverage the advantages associated with EMI [9]. While there are a number of technologies and workflows associated with medical imaging, a crucial technological aspect of EMI involves the use of PACS platforms for the efficient and effective storage of medical images. A PACS platform is a standards-based image repository platform for storing, managing and accessing medical images.This project is about investigating the feasibility of designing and implementing an intelligent, interoperable and useful PACS platform for the efficient and effective storage, management and access of digital medical image data. Specifically, due to the large quantities of medical images that are generated by various modalities, the project is aimed at investigating the use of machine learning techniques for the automated classification of medical images stored in PACS platforms.'
